# Your weakness
To be honest, my speaking English is not fluent. But I am trying to overcome it by following up some tutorials on youtube and making friends with native speaks. Although it is far away to be as fluent as a native speaker, I would never give up.

# What is your current workflow
My workflow is kind of agile development. It is an iterative and team based approach. Basicaly, time is split into phases called ‘sprint’. Typically the span of a sprint is one week. At the start of sprint, teammates would meet together and negotiate the running list of deliverables. All deliverables would be prioritized by business value. Once a functionality is done, I have to design a unit test and notify others to review my code. The system would automatically check the code style and report conflict with other branches. The feature cannot be merged into the production branch until all those stuff are done. If all features cannot be completed, work is reprioritized at the future sprint.
Pro: customer could early see the work and make decisions.
Drawback: refactoring.

# What conflict?
Yeah, I never have a major one but conflicts definitely occurs in some scenarios. Generally, I would meet with my teammate or boss, be a thoughtful listener to understand their concerns and provided my solution. If compromise cannot be reached, I would documented the conversion, include the item on which we didn’t agree and my solution. Finally, I would submit it to my boss.

I wanna share a conflict with my advisor during my summer research at Singapore. Well, my research focused on multi-task neural network for text classification. We were disagreed on what kind of neural networks should be introduced at shared layer for. At first, I preferred the RNN because it is very popular in the field of machine translation and it could capture the long dependency of words in sentences. But my advisor suggested me to use CNN. He said my task is to detect the sentiment polarity, and objectivity simultaneously. In other words, those tasks are classification problem and CNN fits classification problem. I thought his theory was kind of reasonable but was still specious about it. Thus I came back to set up an experiment to compare the performance. Finally, the result proved that the assumption of my advisor was true. I reported it to my advisor. He was happy for my critical thinking and suggested me to write the experiment result into my paper to make the conclusion more rigorous. So you see, the conflict is not always bad and sometime even brings a positive impact if you deal with it a right way.

# Self-introduction
I am a computer science master student and I’ll graduate by May next year. I’m skilled in Java and my career goal is to become a software architect. In order to get some development experience in real world, I took a backend internship at Alibaba, where I built an intelligence platform to accelerate AI by using sprint boot and Java. I shall say this enterprise internship really help me. I not only made a progress in Java techniques, but also had a closer understand of teamwork and the enterprise production workflow. Besides, I also had some side projects about developing web application and infrastructure projects done by Java and C. In addition, I am proactive in learning advanced techniques like neural network and even published paper about multi-task deep learning. In summary, I am a fast learner, a good team player, and thus could grow fast with the engineering team if I am fortunate to pass interviews.

# Project
I would to talk about the project done during my internship at Alibaba. Because it helped me not only learn senior techniques but also develop good teamwork. Let me introduce the background first. Alibaba is dedicated in AI field and has great teams in good place. Data engineer teams clear and transform data on a powerful platform, data scientist create and test model on another flexible platform. But it is challenging to translate the efforts into business outcome. Alibaba have various skill sets like Java, Python, SQL. Engineers use disjoint tools making collaboration harder. And my team mission is to build bridges between different platforms, unify data pipeline and fully automate the AI workflow. Finally, our platform empowered the coupon team to reduce 1 week for developing recommendation functionality. In the team, I am responsible to bridges offline train module with other upstream and downstream. Specially, I have to achieve parameters of preprocessing and algorithm model, trigger training and send the model to clients. I adopted may senior techniques like design patterns and microservices to make the code succinct and extendable. More than that, I develop a great sense of what works for the business, breaking down a large task into manageable pieces and collaborating with teams to achieve those goals. More than that, I had a closer understanding of team work. During the intern, I tried to be a thoughtful learner to clarify what front engineers need and what functionality could I provide. One efficient way I think is to make the code formative and draw professional diagrams to let others immediately know the code structure, the component and the dependence with each other. 

# Why company

## Thumbtack
Removes many pain points in hiring local professionals and changes the way life operates. Life seems like an non-endless to do list. Repair devices in your room, shoot a video for presentation, plan a wedding, a lot of stuff. Previously, when people wanna find professionals, they would often pay fees to consultants and let them to find fit candidates. But on thumbtack, people could hire professionals for almost anything and pay free. It’s a tremendous stride and I believe the perspective is promising.
