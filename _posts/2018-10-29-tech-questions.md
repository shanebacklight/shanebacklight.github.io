# Functional programming
## What
Functianl programming is so called because a program consists entirely functional. The main function is defined by other functions, which in turn are still difined by more functions, until at the bottom level the functions are language primitives.

## Why
- no assignment. Variables never changes once given a value.
- no side-affect. A function have no affect other that compute itself.
- no flow control. Expression's execution order is irrelevant.
- eliminate a major source of bugs.
- relief programmers of the burden of prescibing the flow control
