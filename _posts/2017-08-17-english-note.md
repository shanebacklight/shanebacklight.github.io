# Databricks
ai and big data are driving innovation across all industries. Innovation such as image recogonition, real time fraud detection and genome sequencing are changing the way business operate. I thought we were well positioned to achieve those innovations. Now I have a great team in place. Data engineers... Data scientist ... But It is challenging to tranlate our efforts into product outcome. We have different skill sets... We use diffrent tools making collebration harder. We spent 90% time with complex data pipelines and disjoint tools just to prepare data for analytics. Security became an afterthouhg. Innovation was a distant dream. Then we adopted the databricks, unified analytic platform. These breakthrough empowered my team to accelerate AI and innovation. It's unified management simplifies data engineering by enforcing data integrity and automating performance. Now my platform teams can make data available for analytics in near real time. It unifies people. Data engineers build data pipelines unifying both steaming and historical data. data scientist build model in one place while business users cosuming real-time dashboard. Databrickes is service. We don't have to manually configure and scale clusters. It's cloud based and for we managed. And enterprise security ensures data is protected.

# Cover Letter

This email can be broken into 3 parts. Subject line, email body and the resume attachment.

The subject line needs to be simple, clear and catch their attention. The content should indicate where you saw the posting, how you came by their direct contact info, and a brief pitch about why you would be a good fit for the role. Lastly, always include a resume attachment. This indicates that you know not to waste their time. It is considered a waste of time if they have to reply to your email to request for your resume. Recruiters would much rather open your resume, skim through it, and determine whether they would like to set up an interview with you right on the spot.

Here are examples for each piece of the email.

**Subject:**

XXFullName application for XXJobTitle XXJobID - Resume Attached

**Email body:**

Hi XX,

I came accross the software engineer role at XXcompany and am interested in applying. I found your contact info via LinkedIn so thought to reach out to you directly. I appreciate you taking the time to consider my application.

Short paragraph on why the company and why you are a great fit for the role.

Best regards,

XXFullName

XXPhone

**Attachment:**

Attach a well formatted, easy to skim resume that contains no spelling or grammatical errors.

Do keep in mind that recruiters receive hundreds of applications from multiple sources so emailing them directly may not always get you a response. It could get lost in all the noise. Deploying this simple and to the point methodology, however, will maximize your likelihood of getting a reply. If you do not hear back within a week, definitely do send a follow up email or try other ways to get your application noticed.

# data mining 写作
This section examines some statistical tests available to compare the difference between two classifiers.

**For illustrative purposes**, **consider** a pair of classification models... **Suppose** MA achieves 85% accuracy when evaluated on a set DA with size nA. **Based on this information**, ..?
The preceding example **raises two key quesions regarding** the statistical significance of the performance metrices.

1. Hom much confidence intervals should be placed on the acc. of Ma?
2. Is it possible to explain **the observed difference in acc.** as a result of **the variation in the composition** of the test sets?

The first quesiont **relates to the issue of estimating** the confidence interval. The seconde questions relates to the issue of testing the staticical siginificance of the observed deviation. These issues are invesitigated in the remainder of this section.

To determine the confidence interval, we have to establish the probability distribution that governs acc measure. This section describe an approach of deriving the confidence interval by modeling the classificaton task as a binomial experiment. Following is a list of characters of a binomail experiment.

## recommendation
Nishanth joined our team for a summer internship. Due to his specialization in Deep Learning, we were glad to have him tackle handwritten digit recognition, a difficult and open problem we had; and Nishanth in the short few months of internship developed a full protoype of a system using image processing for segmentation and CNNs for digit recognition. From the first day on he was determined to deliver great value, and was very organized and independent. Over the course of his internship, he was totally open to feedback and not just took it to heart, but immediately acted and improved on it. So in summary, he not just did a great job researching both modern and traditional methods, he developed a great sense of what works for the business, breaking down the larger task into manageable pieces and collaborating with the team to achieve these goals. More than that, he was always proactive in reaching out whenever he saw an opportunity to connect and learn, and put a lot of effort into very successful presentations to the team, and made tremendous strides in targeting communication to differing audience.
Overall, it was a joy having Nishanth as an intern, and we'd be happy to have him back!

Nishanth is a energetic and skilled individual, with broad skills in data science. His capabiities range from database, web, and application development to analytics and data visualization. More importantly, he has a combination of a curious mind eager to learn new things and an incredible work ethic. He will be an asset to any team or company.

Nishanth is a quick learner and adapted himself in the project in a short span when he joined as an entry level analyst. He possesses a strong technical knowledge on Full Stack Web development and data analytics which helped him grow with the team. He is a good team player where he mentored his juniors to the path of success and well-committed person to rely on for any deliverable. He is always organized, goal oriented and dedicated to meet high customer satisfaction rate. Nishanth would be an asset to any team, and I wish him all success in his life endeavors.

Nishanth is a proficient developer come mentor. I have worked on several projects with him over the span of 6 years where he proved time and again that he can emerge from a complex situation, he is cool headed in handling complex and delicate situations. He also has good experience in working on multiple projects simultaneously. His deep knowledge and professional experience in the field of Big data and Full Stack Web development is always impressive. I wish all good happens to him and reach great heights in future.

Nishanth is one of the hardest working students I've ever met. He takes the initiative to gain new knowledge and pursue solutions to complex problems. He will take a basic problem statement and use it as an opportunity to discover advanced problem solving skills. His communication skills are also exemplary. Nishanth will be an asset to any organization striving to find the value proposition in big data.
