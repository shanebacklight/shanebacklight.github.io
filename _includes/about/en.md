Hi all, this is Xuanyi (Shane) Li, a computer science master. I am an energetic and skilled individual and specialized myself in the field of distributed system and machine learning.

I took a back-end engineer summer internship at Alibaba and built an internal platform to accelerate AI. The framework we use are mainly SpringBoot and distributed middlewares. Iâ€™m responsible for hooking up the offline train platform with other streams, like preprocessing and online deployment. The platform empowered the coupon team to reduce one week for tweaking their recommendation model.

I really enjoyed this internship and understood production workflow better, including documentation, drawing of UML and sequence diagram, designing MySQL table, using git for collaboration, writing unit test with JUnit and mockito, and beyond. More than that, I acquired skills of adopting some practical design pattern into the code and gained elementary knowledge of system design, like how to integrate RPC, message queue, cache together.

Besides, I have eager mind to learn advanced technical knowledge. By doing research about neural network based natural language processing, I am well aware of Python, Keras and web crawling and published a short paper on IEEE DSAA.

In summary, I am an eager beaver, good team player and could contribute to the efforts of the engineering team.
